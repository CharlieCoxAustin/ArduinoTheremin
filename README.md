# Arduino-Theremin
A basic theremin using a distance sensor, a passive buzzer, and some LED lights. Reprogrammable to scales and colors of your choosing!
import the proper libraries, then feel free to change the notes, colors, and distances to whatever you'd like!
default setting is A harmonic minor, but try changing to C major, or a chromatic scale, or get weird and set it to just do arpeggios!
Add more if-else statements to increase the number of notes you can play.

pin 12 is the trig pin,
pin 11 is echo,
and pins 6,5, and 9 go to an RGB LED


Requires the "pitches" library and the "HC-SR04" library to work. They can both be found in the elegoo super starter kit.
